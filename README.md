# E-Commerce Store 🏪

This ecommerce store is created using React for the frontend, Commerce.js for the backend and Stripe for the payment method.

CommerceJS is an API-first eCommerce platform geared towards developers, designers, and businesses to create custom eCommerce experiences on, web, mobile, and beyond.

You can add products to your cart, checkout your cart, and pay for it! _(Site not really accepting payment, since I didn't used an actual credit card for payment gateway. )_ 🤣

You can check the deployed site here 🚀:

## You can also check the project's other branch, [here](https://github.com/davebanguilan/Project_Website_ECommerce/tree/MOBILE_BRANCH).

^This branch can be also deployed and accept **REAL** credit cards payments using stripe. _*Note:* Some configuration is needed to be done in the commerce.js backend in order to setup stripe payment method._
